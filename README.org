#+TITLE: N-Queens: Solved by Random Greedy Heuristic and Genetic N-Queen Solver
#+AUTHOR: M. Yas. Davoodeh

This is a demonstration for a couple of university courses which I took (some
ML/AI).

There is little to no explanation about how Rust works. This repo is not
intended for that.

The code is quite messy with a lot of verbose printings, maximum indentation and
single functions which do multiple actions. This is written in like 8 hours
total and was intended to be as simple as possible so I just wrote the whole
algorithm as a single procedure in both modes. Not that I like it this way, I
just don't care to put more effort into it.

To see a cleaner documentation about the code run ~cargo doc~ and to run it, run
~cargo run -- ARGS~.

Example outputs of both modes are in ~*-example.txt~ files.
